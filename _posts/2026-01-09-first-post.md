## Hello! 👋

I just created my github blog.

From now on, I will write some posts on Mathematics, Data Science and AI.

Writing in Markdown syntax is still unfamiliar, but I will learn it step by step.

### Future Plans
* commit some posts on mathematics
* organize and upload projects
* record algorithm problem solutions

Thanks for reading!
